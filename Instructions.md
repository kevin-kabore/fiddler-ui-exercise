## Goals for this exercise:
Build a UI based on the screenshot included in the project directory. Your solution must be written in React. We're looking for a concise heirarchy of React components. Please do not use a UI framework to build your interface (including but not limited to Bootstrap, Material-UI, and Semantic UI).

Sadly, the design spec is just a picture. You won't be able to inspect each element for exact style specifications. It's not important to get all the details pixel perfect, but your solution should be of equivalent visual quality. The UI needs to pass "the eye test".

Icons used in the screenshot and starter project come from the Material-UI icons package. There's a dependency on the Material-UI core, which you should not use for anything other than icons.

Our evaluation will focus on:
* clean component composition based on modern React design principles
* responsive layout for big, small, tall, and wide screens
* high-quality CSS, preferabbly defined in an authoring package like styled-components or react-jss

We won't evaluate:
* Your ability to copy latin- use whatever text takes up roughly the same amount of space.
* Precisely the same icons, colors, fonts, dropshadows, margins, etc.

## README:
Include a README that answers the following questions:

* How much time did you spend on the assignment?
* What do you like about your implementation?
* If you were to restart, what would you change about your implementation?

If you didn't use the starter code, please include instructions on how to build and run your project. It's very important that we can see and interact with your submission during our evaluation process.

## Starter code:

To use the starter code: navigate to this project directory, run `yarn install` to install dependencies (this may take a couple of minutes), and then run `yarn start` to initialize and connect to a node server with your default browser. Use as much or as little of the starter code as you'd like.
